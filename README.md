# pocket-auth-cli

A small node.js command line tool for getting an access token for the [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) API.

### Usage

```bash
npm install -g pocket-auth-cli
pocket-auth <consumer_key>
```

### FAQ

#### How do I get a consumer key?
Visit the [Pocket developer apps page](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/)

#### I don't have any applications created
You can [create an app](https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new). Make sure to add all of the permissions you need. It doesn't matter which platform you choose (I use `web`).
